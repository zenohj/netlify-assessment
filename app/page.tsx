          It&apos;s easy to use and highly configurable. I love how extensions are seamlessly integrated, and with the rise of new technologies, Copilot has been integrated ‚Äî giving programmers, developers, and web designers a boost in productivity. It helps with suggestions for best terms, lines, functions, and even error detection and correction. VS Code makes the coding experience smooth and efficient.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">
          A delay in troubleshooting will be inevitable when it comes to DNS configuration for less-technical customers. As you explain from basic terms to functionality, they might raise follow-up questions that extend the process.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic">
          The second challenge is connected: if there&apos;s a delay in troubleshooting or setup, there&apos;s a high chance of failing to deliver solutions in a timely manner ‚Äî especially when deadlines are involved.

      {/* üîê Final Security Escalation Section */}
      <Section title="Final Question: Responding to a Severe Security Report" borderColor="border-sharinganRed">
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-4">
          We understand you don&apos;t know anything about our internal procedures at this stage, but we want you to explain at a high level how you&apos;d react to this situation: You receive a report of a severe security issue on www.netlify.com. You can&apos;t immediately confirm the report, so what steps might you take to investigate or substantiate the report? What might you say to the reporter, even though we haven&apos;t confirmed their assertion yet, that will instill confidence that our business is very concerned about security? You believe there is a reasonable chance the report is correct and the problem is very large and impactful. How might you escalate?
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-hokageOrange mb-2">My Answer</h3>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">
          First I would acknowledge and thank the user for reaching out to us. I would avoid making statements that could lead to confusion or false assumptions. The safest move would be to let the user know that we will coordinate the report with the appropriate team and assure them that we take security seriously.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic">
          I would gather more information such as when the issue started, when it last occurred (or if it&apos;s still visible), and then notify our leads and cybersecurity team ‚Äî if we have one or are allowed to communicate directly.

      {/* üîÅ Redirect and Proxy Setup Section */}
      <Section title="Redirect and Proxy Setup Explanation" borderColor="border-sharinganRed">
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">
          <strong>Question:</strong> How would you set up an HTTP 301 status redirect from <code>/netlify/anything</code> on your site to <code>https://www.google.com/search?q=anything</code>? Please provide the redirect formatting here. Now, how about a proxy redirect? Please add that proxy redirect rule directly to your site!
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">
          <strong>Answer:</strong> I have created a folder under <code>/public</code> named <code>_redirects</code> and added these lines:
        </p>
        <pre className="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded-md text-sm overflow-x-auto mb-4">
          /netlify/:query  https://www.google.com/search?q=:query  301!{'\n'}
          /proxy-search/:query  https://www.google.com/search?q=:query  200
        </pre>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic">
          The first rule performs a permanent redirect (301) from any <code>/netlify/anything</code> path to a Google search. The second rule sets up a proxy redirect that keeps the URL path but fetches content from Google.

    <strong>Question:</strong> Please attempt to deploy a function on our service. This need not be complicated. It could be "Hello World". Note that failure to deploy is not failing the exercise! Whether you have trouble or not, please describe what you experienced and how you attempted to troubleshoot any issues you encountered.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">
    <strong>Answer:</strong> I have visited the hyperlink for functions in Netlify to check how to successfully create it. My first attempt did not land any errors and the build was deployed smoothly.
  </p>
  <p className="text-lg text-gray-100 italic mb-2">Steps Proceeded:</p>
  <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-100 italic mb-4">
    <li>Created a new folder in the project: <code>netlify/functions</code></li>
    <li>Created a file inside <code>netlify/functions</code> named <code>hello.js</code></li>
    <li>Commented the file path: <code>//netlify/functions/hello.js</code></li>
